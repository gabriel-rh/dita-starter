Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS \(ROSA\) with hosted control planes \(HCP\) offers a reduced-cost solution to create a managed ROSA cluster with a focus on efficiency. You can quickly create a new cluster and deploy applications in minutes.

## Key features of ROSA with HCP {#key-features-of-rosa}

-   ROSA with HCP requires a minimum of only two nodes, making it ideal for smaller projects while still being able to scale to support larger projects and enterprises.
-   The underlying control plane infrastructure is fully managed. Control plane components, such as the API server and etcd database, are hosted in a Red Hat-owned AWS account.
-   Provisioning time is approximately 10 minutes.
-   Customers can upgrade the control plane and machine pools separately, which means they do not have to shut down the entire cluster during upgrades.
